<h2>Final Project : Automatic card dealer </h2>
<p>An automatic card dealer is a machine which can deal poker cards by activating  raspberry pi3. </p>
<h3>what you will need</h3>
<ul>If you want to build an automatic card dealer, you will need to prepare these following things first.

	<li>digital SD card</li>
	<li>ARDUINO ULN2003+ Stepper motor (5V) x2</li>
	<li>Several DuPont lines</li>
	<li>A breadboard</li>
	<li>Cardboard</li>
	<li>a deck of cards</li>
	<li>some paperclips</li>
	<li>some other complements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Start to build the machine</h3>
<ul>After preparing what we will need for the project, we are ready to start!</br>
Now the following content will be divided into 2 parts, which are hardware and software respectively.
  <li><h4>hardware</h4>
  	About the hardware, we will have to create a machine to put your poker cards in first. I only made some change based on the poker cardâ€™s box, but you can also do it in lots of different ways since it is a little unstable using cardboard as the body of the machine. </ul>
  	<ul>The pictures below is the actual appearance of the machine body I made.
