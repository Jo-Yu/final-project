<h2>Final Project : Automatic card dealer </h2>
<p>An automatic card dealer is a machine which can deal poker cards by activating  raspberry pi3. </p>
<h3>what you will need</h3>
<ul>If you want to build an automatic card dealer, you will need to prepare these following things first.
	<li>Raspberry pi3 model B</li>
	<li>digital SD card</li>
	<li>ARDUINO ULN2003+ Stepper motor (5V) x2</li>
	<li>Several DuPont lines</li>
	<li>A breadboard</li>
	<li>Cardboard</li>
	<li>a deck of cards</li>
	<li>some paperclips</li>
	<li>some other complements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Start to build the machine</h3>
<ul>After preparing what we will need for the project, we are ready to start!</br>
Now the following content will be divided into 2 parts, which are hardware and software respectively.
  <li><h4>hardware</h4>
  	About the hardware, we will have to create a machine to put your poker cards in first. I only made some change based on the poker cardâ€™s box, but you can also do it in lots of different ways since it is a little unstable using cardboard as the body of the machine. </ul>
The pictures below is the actual appearance of the machine body I made.

<p> After you made the body, next we will have to build the circuit.</br>
The following is the gpio of raspberry pi3.

To activate the stepper motors with raspberry pi3, we will have to connect the stepper motors to the gpio that can output 5V and ground.</p>
The following pictures show the circuit I connect. You can use them for reference.
